# 2-Sum

The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm covered in https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures/home/week/4.

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).This is your array of integers, with the ith row of the file specifying the ith entry of the array.

Your task is to compute the number of target values tt in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t. (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm from lecture.)
